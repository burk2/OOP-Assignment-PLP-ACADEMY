# OOP Assignment – Masai Nolly

This repository contains my submission for the Object-Oriented Programming assignment.

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
I created a `Drum` class representing a traditional African musical instrument. It includes attributes like name, material, and origin, and methods to describe and play the drum.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
I implemented three transport mode classes—`Bicycle`, `Matatu`, and `Train`—each with a `.move()` method that behaves differently to demonstrate polymorphism.
